    <p class="about-us-quality-description">
      Although we work with growers who pay close attention to all stages of harvest and processing,
      we employ, on our end, a rigorous quality control program to avoid over-roasting or baking the coffee dry.
      Every bag of coffee is tagged with a roast date and batch number. Our goal is to roast consistent, user-friendly coffee, so that brewing is easy and enjoyable.
