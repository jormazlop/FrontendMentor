    <h1>What your BMI result means</h1>
    <p>
      A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a
      healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on,
      such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced
      fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally,
      strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for
      five days a week.
