<h2 class="text-2 home-title">Hi, Iâ€™m Paulina ðŸ‘‹</h2>

<p class="text-7 home-description">
  Iâ€™m on a journey to become a front-end web developer. I love building little
  projects, trying out new coding techniques, and sharing what I learn along the
  way. When Iâ€™m not at my desk, youâ€™ll find me reading, hiking through the
  mountains, or challenging myself on rock-climbing walls.

  <br /><br />

  I started this blog to document my progress, keep myself accountable, and
  hopefully inspire anyone else whoâ€™s learning to code. Welcome to my corner of
  the internet, and thanks for stopping by!
